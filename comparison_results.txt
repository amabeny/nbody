Comparison: CPU vs. GPU n-body simulation

Test Case: 1000 Particles, 10 Steps

CPU Execution Time: 0.095 seconds
GPU Execution Time (SLURM): 0.059 seconds

Test Case: 10000 Particles, 10 Steps

CPU Execution Time: 0.099 seconds
GPU Execution Time (SLURM): 0.470 seconds

Test Case: 100000 Particles, 10 Steps

CPU Execution Time: 0.133 seconds
GPU Execution Time (SLURM): 23.449 seconds

Observations:

- For 1000 particles, the GPU execution time was faster than the CPU.
- For 10000 particles, the CPU execution time was faster than the GPU execution time.
- For 100000 particles, the CPU execution time was significantly faster than the GPU execution time.
